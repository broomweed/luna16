Hey! This is still a work in progress, but thanks for checking it out.

This is an emulator for a nonexistent game console. ("fantasy console")

Its architecture is sort of based on the NES/GBC, but it has a 16-bit CPU that
executes instructions for an architecture that I made up.

As of right now, we have an emulator (main.c) that can do graphics and keyboard
support and not much else, and we have about 40% of a really basic assembler
(assem.py).

I wouldn't recommend trying to run it yet, since there's not much documentation
and you can't do very much with it yet!
